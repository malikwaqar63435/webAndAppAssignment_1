<p>Assalam U Alaikum</p>
<br><br>
<p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so.He may multiply it for him many times over?(Surat Baqra,Verse 245)</p>
<br><br>
<p>It should be noted that Allah, who is need of no one and nothing,instills upon his man to give Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man
    nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth.Allah speaks about Qarz because it is returned and Allah promises that.
He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds.Allah conveys his message to the muslims ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad promoting 
Muslims to spend their wealth in certain way .He says,Oh children of Adam!.Trust me with your wealth.If you do so ,no fire,flood or thieves
will be able to rob you off your money.Instead,you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it .He further says that the poor 
and weak will not remain hungry and naiked except due to the negligence of the rich ,who should not be stingy in spending their money on 
those worse off than themselves.Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but he will also punish them accodingly
On the day of judgement,the rich will be humiliated because they did not help the needy .The needy will complain to Allah and say that 
all those men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of the wealth showed negligence in its proper use ;they were busy spending on 
themselves and forgot about us;the ones who needed it.Allah will reply to this and say ."I swear on my respect and glory! I will bring
you closer to me and push them further away."   </p><br><br>
<p>Alhumdulilah Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favor by sending those people our way who follow the teaching
    of the Holy Quran and Hadith,give zakat,fidyab,fitrah khairat and other donations to help us help those in need.The purpose of
    this message sending to you is so that you not only spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue
    serving and helping the needy till the day of judgement.
